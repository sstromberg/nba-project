The NBA publishes a lot of useful data on its website, at stats.nba.com, but it doesn't let you make custom leaderboards, and
some of the advanced player-tracking data isn't available for free.

This project uses data from the NBA to explore some questions around player defense -- in particular, starting with backcourt
players using the 2018-19 regular season.

We start by asking which players are likely to have a team's best defender assigned to them, then we look at the players they
matched up against to try to build a list of those top defenders.
