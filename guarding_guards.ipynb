    "# Who guards the guards?\n",
    "\n",
    "NBA teams value lockdown defenders -- a player who can keep their opponent's star from controlling the game. Although some defensive specialists are widely recognized around the league, and may play extensively despite limited offensive games, others may be overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The current stats landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the stats that are currently available to quantify defense are either basic (but public) or sophisticated but proprietary. In the former category, we have models based on complex configurations of the basic box-score stats: John Hollinger's PER; Dean Oliver's DRtg, which is used in Justin Kubatko's Win Shares; and Daniel Myers's Boxscore Plus/Minus. In the latter, the NBA has real-time player-tracking video systems maintained in all of its arenas, and presumably grants teams and other partners access to enormous volumes of granular data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The league has released some measures derived from this data, abstracted up a couple levels, at stats.nba.com, and I think there's an opportunity to develop some new public metrics that go beyond what's in the box score. (Note that box-score-based metrics are important because they allow historic comparisons to other eras -- the limited inputs are a feature for many research questions, while the Second Spectrum tracking data only started with the 2017-18 season.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### This project\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I'll use publicly-released data from the NBA to identify the players most frequently tasked with challenging defensive assignments -- limited to guards for now -- and look at some related questions, like:\n",
    "- Does top-defender-dom persist from year to year?\n",
    "- How are teams with two important offensive players defended? How do teams with two top defenders assign them?\n",
    "- How do these matchups change in the playoffs?"

    "## What's our universe of \"important offensive players\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start by using a Usage leaderboard, which reflects the proportion of a team's possessions in which that player was last to touch the ball (either by shooting it or turning it over). Because turnovers are most likely when a player is either dribbling the ball or passing the ball, this component is a reasonable approximation for players who spend the most time handling the ball, even if they don't shoot as often themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could consider incorporating Assist Ratio, which is the proportion of possessions for which that player receives credit for an assist (the last pass leading directly to a made shot), but assists are noisier than the components of usage. For one, assists are determined subjectively by official scorekeepers on the basis of whether that last pass was sufficiently proximate to the shot -- scorekeepers are tied to an arena and have been demonstrated to show a bias in awarding more assists to the home team. In addition, two passes of equal quality will not be treated identically because assists are only awarded if the shot is made, so a miss (or a shooting foul drawn) can't be assisted. As a result, Assist Ratio is dependent on whether the game is home or on the road, and on the shooting ability of a player's teammate (and to a smaller extent on the skill of the defender guarding that teammate). So we'll set it aside for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we'll focus on Guards for now -- we want a relatively homogeneous pool of offensive players so that a standout defender is likely to be matched up against most or all of them. In particular, a player who can match up against a point guard could also handle other perimeter players but not necessarily centers."

    "This looks good! James Harden played 4 games against OKC, New Orleans, Dallas, and Utah, and 3 against Phoenix, so he likely faced those teams' primary defenders most often. In addition, OKC and New Orleans have individual defenders who are very highly-regarded in Paul George and Jrue Holiday (both of whom matched up the most against Harden). Utah has a top-rated team defense but their top defender plays at center, while Phoenix is near the bottom of the league -- so Harden's shooting percentage (FG_PCT) and 3-point percentage (FG3_PCT) fields in those matchups seem to roughly agree with what we'd expect to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we can look at the bottom line of the printout -- showing we have about 74 possessions per game worth of matchup data -- and see that this API output is **complete**. James Harden averaged a little more than 36 minutes per game (and games are 48 minutes long, plus a few overtime games per season), and NBA teams play roughly 100 possessions each over the course of a game, with Harden's Houston a little slower than league average (97.9). So this is exactly what we would expect, for a dataset that includes every possession where the offensive player is on the floor, whether he touches the ball or not.\n",

    "Keeping in mind that our unit of analysis is an offensive player-defensive player matchup, both of the above COUNT columns refer to the number of offensive players (from our original list of 30) that a player matched up against. So **Avery Bradley** faced just about every offensive standout in the league (and it's possible one of the other two is his teammate), while **Brandon Ingram** (who plays small forward and often guards larger players, and who missed time this season with injuries) has matchedup against about half of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SUM columns tell you how many times that offense-defense matchup actually faced each other -- because the NBA has an unbalanced schedule (with teams playing divisional and conference rivals more often), and because most players don't play every game of the year, we expect some variation here. **Bradley Beal** played all 82 games this season, and accrued 57 game-matchups against offensive stars (although since some of those stars may be teammates, this may not be 57 distinct games).\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAX columns are really just a sanity check -- it's possible for two players to meet more than four times in a regular season, but it would require one or both of them to change teams (by being traded, for example). Similarly, since a star player will be on the court for 70-80 possessions per game, and defenders don't always end up matched up against their main assignment (because their rests don't align, defensive switches, or other reasons) the maximum possessions for a given matchup tops out at 40/game (e.g., for CJ McCollum), which seems reasonable.\n",

We'll use both POSS.count, which indicates a given defender has been matched up against many of our list of 30 offensive leaders, and POSS.mean, so the defender has covered them lots of times over the course of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does introduce a little bit of bias, since the unequal schedule and non-uniform distribution of offensive leaders means **some players have a larger opportunity space than others**. In other words, it's hard to identify a standout defender if they never had a star to defend... which is a problem intrinsic to this source of data."

Then we can open up some of the parameters and look for players that may have flown under the radar."

Possibly because of changes in defensive scheme or tactical considerations (teams can do more opponent-centric game planning in the playoffs), we see centers like Al Horford, Clint Capela, and Dario Saric in our list of defenders. This is most likely the result of an early switch -- when a team runs a screening play, sometimes the defense swaps assignments and leaves a center on a guard (and vice versa) -- or a fast-break possession, when the defense is scrambling and can't reach their preferred matchups. These matchups are likely the result of the offense doing something it wants to, in other words, rather than the defense deliberately seeking them out."
