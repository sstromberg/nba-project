    "- Does top-defender-dom persist from year to year?\n",

    "## What's our universe of \"important offensive players\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start by using a Usage leaderboard, which reflects the proportion of a team's possessions in which that player was last to touch the ball (either by shooting it or turning it over). Because turnovers are most likely when a player is either dribbling the ball or passing the ball, this component is a reasonable approximation for players who spend the most time handling the ball, even if they don't shoot as often themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could consider incorporating Assist Ratio, which is the proportion of possessions for which that player receives credit for an assist (the last pass leading directly to a made shot), but assists are noisier than the components of usage. For one, assists are determined subjectively by official scorekeepers on the basis of whether that last pass was sufficiently proximate to the shot -- scorekeepers are tied to an arena and have been demonstrated to show a bias in awarding more assists to the home team. In addition, two passes of equal quality will not be treated identically because assists are only awarded if the shot is made, so a miss (or a shooting foul drawn) can't be assisted. As a result, Assist Ratio is dependent on whether the game is home or on the road, and on the shooting ability of a player's teammate (and to a smaller extent on the skill of the defender guarding that teammate). So we'll set it aside for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we'll focus on Guards for now -- we want a relatively homogeneous pool of offensive players so that a standout defender is likely to be matched up against most or all of them. In particular, a player who can match up against a point guard could also handle other perimeter players but not necessarily centers."

    "Keeping in mind that our unit of analysis is an offensive player-defensive player matchup, both of the above COUNT columns refer to the number of offensive players (from our original list of 30) that a player matched up against. So Avery Bradley faced just about every offensive standout in the league (and it's possible one of the other two is his teammate), while Brandon Ingram (who plays small forward and often guards larger players, and who missed time this season with injuries) has matchedup against about half of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SUM columns tell you how many times that offense-defense matchup actually faced each other -- because the NBA has an unbalanced schedule (with teams playing divisional and conference rivals more often), and because most players don't play every game of the year, we expect some variation here. Bradley Beal played all 82 games this season, and accrued 57 game-matchups against offensive stars (although since some of those stars may be teammates, this may not be 57 distinct games).\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAX columns are really just a sanity check -- it's possible for two players to meet more than four times in a regular season, but it would require one or both of them to change teams (by being traded, for example). Similarly, since a star player will be on the court for 70-80 possessions per game, and defenders don't always end up matched up against their main assignment (because their rests don't align, defensive switches, or other reasons) the maximum possessions for a given matchup tops out at 40/game (e.g., for CJ McCollum), which seems reasonable.\n",

We'll use both POSS.count, which indicates a given defender has been matched up against many of our list of 30 offensive leaders, and POSS.mean, so the defender has covered them lots of times over the course of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does introduce a little bit of bias, since the unequal schedule and non-uniform distribution of offensive leaders means **some players have a larger opportunity space than others**. In other words, it's hard to identify a standout defender if they never had a star to defend... which is a problem intrinsic to this source of data."
